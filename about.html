          <h4>Background Info</h4>
          
          <p>
            I'm a computer science student at Dalhousie University. I moved from Toronto to Halifax about 3 years ago. For most of my life before that, I wasn't really a good student. I always procrastinated and came late to class, but midway through Grade 12, I became inspired to turn things around. After failing my Grade 11 English class and being a C student throughout high school, I decided to drop out so that I could come back the next year to try and do better. A lot of my teachers were skeptical, but I felt that if I truly applied myself, I would be able to get good grades. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Then COVID happened. 
          </p>

          <p>
            This really messed up my plans, and I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to come back the next year and take all my courses online. My dad and I eventually decided to move to Halifax where, conveniently, the high schools were still offering in-person education. When September came around, I buckled down and made sure to stay on top of my deadlines. I was determined to get into the engineering program at Dal, despite having a mark of 50 for Grade 12 math and never having taken Grade 11 chemistry. I had none of the prerequisites for any of my programs of choice, except a 75 in English (which I barely managed to pull off). It was a really hard semester. I failed my first calculus test. Nevertheless, I stuck to the plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then June arrived and I got my report card. I ended up with a 95 in calculus, a 93 in chemistry, and an 80 in physics. I had never felt so accomplished in my whole life, and I got accepted into Dal's engineering, computer science, and finance programs. I chose computer science because of my love for math (also not a big fan of chemistry).

          <h4>What Now?</h4>

          <p>
            These days, I'm a full-time university student taking web development, computer systems, and calculus 1. I live in residence at Risley Hall, and I love the immersive experience. There have been times when I've gone weeks without leaving campus because everything I need is right here.
